In this repository, I am going to share how we can deploy our model on Heroku using the Flask web framework.

We can deploy our ML model on Heroku with three steps:

1- Deploy our ML model using Flask.

2- Design the interface with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

3- Deploy our ML model on Heroku.


We need to install these libraries for our Flask app :

| pip install Flask | pip install xgboost | pip install pandas | pip install joblib | Flask for creating the web application, XGBoost for our machine learning model, pandas for data manipulation, and joblib for loading the pre-trained model.
